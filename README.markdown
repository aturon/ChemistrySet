# Chemistry Set

The Scala Chemistry Set is an experiment in generalizing both the join
calculus and CML into a single concurrency/parallelism library,
incorporating ideas from scalable parallel implementations of each
([CML](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr/papers/2009/icfp-parallel-cml.pdf),
[Joins](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/turon/scalable-joins.pdf)).
